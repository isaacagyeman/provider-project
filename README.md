# providerproject

This is a project I built to test my knowledge and try my hands on the famous state management package (provider)

## Getting Started

This project is a mixture of sub-projects built into one:
- Todo page
- Food page
- Jokes page
- Track Ip address

 All the above mentioned pages were implemented using third party apis and the provider package for state management.
Except for the Track IP address page that is yet to be completed.
